Being loosely quarantined at home, I have noticed some news on social media. In my last entry, I gave an overview of some theories about the origin of the 2019-nCoV viurs. I'd like to resume with the coverage about supports from other provinces and even aboard to Wuhan. 

As a matter of fact, Wuhan has fallen short of medical staff and supplies since the blockdown of the city on January 23 and hospitals within Wuahn have been running largely over-capicity. Unlike the Sichuan Earthquake in 2009 after which many civilians went to the rescues immediately, this epidemic don't alow for civilian rescues. Squads of well trained doctors and nurses from other province-level places, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shanxi, have been flying into Wuhan voluntarily. Many foreign experts, such as viral expert Rolf Hilgenfeld from Germany and epidemologist Lipkin from the U.S., have came to China to fight shoulder-by-shoulder with Chinese experts. 

Runing out of medical supplies, many front-line docters and nurses, exposed to the danger of affection, have been in desperate need of face masks and goggles. Being mindful of that, many Chinese expats have reached out, buying packs of face masks and goggles to send into Wuhan, which even leads to a global shortage. Some countries, including Russia, Pakistan, and Japan, have also shipped tons of medical supplies by flight. Regardless of the quantity of donated stuff, this has convyed a message that they are supporting us against this public health issue. In contrary, some American officials blatantly claimed that this epidemic offered a good opportunity for jobs returning to the U.S. 

Friend in need is friend indeed. I feel lucky to be living in a cohesive country and a human world. On the other hand, irresponsible politicians and other kind of public figures could be toxic and mislead the general public.
